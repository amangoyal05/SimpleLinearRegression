  <li><b>Linear Regression - Sheet1.csv</b><br>
  This is our dataset which contains all the important information we will be needing. This data will be split into training data and testing data on the basis of which our model will be able to predict an outcome.<p></li>
  <li><b>simplelinear.ipynb</b><br>
  This is the main Jupyter Notebook in which we have written the code and used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to plot graphs to get a better visual representation of our dataset and using scikit toolkits for the training and testing of data and to check the accuracy of our model.</li>
